  # Snapping

  In this exercise, we will create a program where a marker (crosshairs) moves to follow the mouse cursor. However, instead of following the mouse exactly, the marker will jump to fixed positions on a grid. This concept is called _snapping_.

  Imagine your screen as a grid, where each square is 40 pixels wide and tall. Instead of the marker being able to move smoothly between all the pixels, it will always "snap" or jump to the nearest corner of a grid square. This helps the marker stay aligned to the grid, giving it a more structured movement. The following image shows the intended behavior:

  In addition to the snapping behavior, you also have to write the current x/y position of the marker in the left lower corner of the canvas.

  ## Tips

  To find the nearest corner to snap to, you must divide the current mouse position by the grid size (40 pixels) and then round the result to the nearest integer. Rounding is done with _Math.round(...)_. Here are some examples:
  
  * _Math.round(3.6)_ returns 4
  * _Math.round(3.4)_ returns 3
  * _Math.round(x)_ returns 2 assuming that _x_ is 2.3.
