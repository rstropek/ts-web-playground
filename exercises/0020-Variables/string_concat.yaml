  # String Concat

  In this exercise you will learn how to concatenate strings. You have to write a program that records the position of mouse clicks. Here is how the program should look like:

  ![String Concat](https://github.com/rstropek/ts-web-playground/blob/main/exercises/0020-Variables/string_concat.gif?raw=true)

  At the beginning, the program should simulate a click at the position 0/0. Whenever the user clicks, draw a circle and add ",10/15" (assuming that the user clicked at the position 10/15). With every click, the "click protocol" gets longer.

  ## Tips

  Until now, we always used three parameters for the _text()_ method. The call _text("Hello", 10, 10)_ draws the text _Hello_ at the position 10/10. If we want to have _text wrapping_ (i.e. text continuing in the next line), we use five parameters. The call _text("Hello", 10, 10, 100, 100)_ draws the text _Hello_ at the position 10/10. If a line of text is longer than 100 pixels, it continues in the next line. This is continued until the text reaches the position 100/100.

  You will need a **global variable** to store the "click protocol". It has to be of type _string_.
