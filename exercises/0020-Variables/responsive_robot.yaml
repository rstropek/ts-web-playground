  # Responsive Robot

  If you build a user interface, you often have to deal with different screen sizes and orientations (landscape vs. portrait). In this exercise, you have to draw the robot that you already know from a previous homework. However, this time, the size of the shapes must be relative to the canvas size. Here you see two variants of the robot for different canvas sizes:

  Here is a detailed description of how to draw the robot's shapes:

  ## Tips

  The robot's eyes are 20% of the smaller side of the head. To get the minimum of two values, use the method _Math.min(...)_. For example, _Math.min(100, 200)_ returns 100. _Math.min(x, y)_ returns the smaller of the two values _x_ and _y_.

  The starter code contains several variables (e.g. _headWidth_). They are declared with _const_. Therefore, their values cannot be changed (i.e. is constant). If you have a variable that you want to change, use _let_ instead of _const_.

      function setup() {

        background("lightgray");

        // Define relative sizes and positions based on canvas width and height
        const headWidth = width * 0.50; // Head size as 50% of the canvas width
        const headHeight = height * 0.50; // Head size as 50% of the canvas width
        const headX = width / 2 - headWidth / 2; // Center the head horizontally
        const headY = height / 2 - headHeight / 2; // Center the head vertically

        // Draw the robot's head
        fill("gray");
        rect(headX, headY, headWidth, headHeight);
