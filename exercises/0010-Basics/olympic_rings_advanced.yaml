  # Olympic Rings

  You already created the Olympic rings. Now, let's make it more challenging.

  ![Olympic symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Olympic_rings_without_rims.svg/200px-Olympic_rings_without_rims.svg.png)

  Maybe you have already noticed that the rings overlap in a specific way. Take a close look at the image and try to figure out how the rings are overlapping. The starter code is a solution that partly solves the challenge. Run it and compare the result with the image above. Do you spot the difference?

  Notice the _arc(...)_ method. Play around with the parameters to see how they affect the resulting shape. Your task is to **fix the red ring** as it doesn't overlap with the other rings correctly.

  ## Tips

  To get a better understanding of the _arc(...)_ method and its parameters, comment out all the code except a single _arc(...)_ call. You do that by inserting _/*_ after the first _arc(...)_ call and _*/_ before the closing curly bracket. This is how your code should look like (note that _..._ is a placeholder for the missing, unmodified code):
  
  ```ts
  function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 200);
    
    ...
    
    arc(100, 100, 80, 80, 45, 315);
    /*
    // Parts of black ring
    stroke("black");
    arc(200, 100, 80, 80, 135, 315);
    
    ...
    
    arc(200, 100, 80, 80, 315, 45);
    */
  }

  When you are left with a single arc, change the parameters to see how the shape changes. Once you have a good understanding of the parameters, you can start fixing the red ring of the Olympic symbol.
