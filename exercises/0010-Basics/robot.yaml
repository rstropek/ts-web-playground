  # Robot

  Your task is to write code that draws a simple robot using basic shapes like rectangles, circles, and lines. This exercise is the first step, and we'll build on this code in future exercises to learn about concepts such as _variables_ and _constants_.

  Below is the example of how your robot should look. You need to match the shapes exactly, but feel free to choose your own colors.

  ## Tips

  1. Start by sketching your robot on checkered paper to get a clear idea of the layout.
  2. Make a list of all the shapes you will need to draw for your robot.
  3. **Having a plan will make your coding much smoother!**
