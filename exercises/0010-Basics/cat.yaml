  # Cat

  Write code that draws a simple cat. Use basic shapes like rectangles, circles, and triangles.

  Here is an example of how the cat could look like. You do not need to follow this example exactly. Feel free to be creative.

  ## Tips

  Is it hard for you to find the correct coordinates? Here is a tip: Take a pice of checkered paper and draw the cat on it. Each square of the paper could be e.g. 10 pixel. This way, you can easily find the correct coordinates.

  Tips for faster typing:

  * Use _Ctrl + c_ (in German _Strg + c_) to copy code. Note that you can copy an entire line by pressing _Ctrl + c_ anywhere in the line. You do not need to mark the text first.
  * Use _Ctrl + v_ to paste code.
  * Did you know that you can move lines up and down with _Alt + Arrow Up_ and _Alt + Arrow Down_?
  * _Ctrl + z_ is also very useful. It undoes the last change you made.
