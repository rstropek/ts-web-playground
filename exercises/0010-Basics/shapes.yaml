  # Shapes

  In this exercise, we learn about how to call _methods_ by drawing
  shapes on a canvas with the _p5js_ library. This exercise is also
  a typing exercise.

  ## Task 1 - Typing

  Type in the following code. Type it **exactly** as it is shown here.
  Every character matters, casing matters, every special character
  and every space is important.

  Note that lines starting with `//` are comments and are not part of
  the code. They are there to help you understand the code. Type them
  in, too. However, if you make a mistake in a comment, it's not a big
  deal.

  ## Task 2 - Understanding the code

  Experiment with the code. Change the parameters of the functions
  and see what happens. When you hover the mouse over a function
  name, you will see a tooltip with the function's documentation.
