  # Shapes

  In this exercise, you will learn how to use _methods_ to draw shapes on a canvas using the _p5.js_ library. This exercise also helps you practice your typing skills.

  ## Task 1 - Typing

  Type the code exactly as shown below. Make sure every character is correct, including uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters, and spaces.

  Note: Lines that start with `//` are comments. These lines are not part of the actual code but are there to help you understand it. You should type them in too. If you make a mistake in a comment, don't worry; it's not a big problem.

  ## Task 2 - Understanding the code

  Play around with the code by changing the function parameters and see what happens. If you hover your mouse over a function name, you will see a tooltip with its documentation.
