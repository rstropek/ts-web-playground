  # Christmas Tree

  In this exercise, you must draw a christmas tree. It must look exactly like this:

  ## Level 1: Drawing the Tree

  Write code that draws a tree that looks as closely as possible to the one shown in the image above.

  **Avoid** specifying hardcoded coordinates in calls to _triangle()_, _circle()_, and _rect()_. Use `translate()` to move the origin of the drawing instead.

  Do not repeat the code for drawing triangles and circles. Use _for_ loops instead.

  ## Level 2: Drawing Rules

  Draw the tree following the following **rules** to the letter:

  1. The tree must be centered horizontally and symmetrical in shape.
  2. The tip (topmost point) of the tree is positioned at the y-coordinate defined by TOP_MARGIN.
  3. The base width of the topmost triangle is set by INITIAL_TRIANGLE_BASE_WIDTH.
  4. The height of each triangle is calculated as 50% (HEIGHT_TO_WIDTH_RATIO) of its base width.
  5. After each triangle is drawn, the origin of the drawing must shift downward by the triangle's height.
  6. For each subsequent layer, both the base width and height of the triangle increase by 50% (SIZE_INCREASE_BY_LAYER).
  7. Draw a Christmas tree ball with a random color on the left- and rightmost edge of each layer.
  8. The tree trunk is drawn at the bottom of the tree. It has a width of TRUNK_WIDTH and a height of TRUNK_HEIGHT.

  Note that the dimensions of the tree must be controlled only by the constants defined at the beginning of the code. Your drawing code must not contain any hardcoded values.
