  # Grid

  In this exercise, you learn the very basics of loops. We start with the _while_ loop.

  You have to draw a grid on the canvas: 

  ![Canvas](https://github.com/rstropek/ts-web-playground/blob/main/exercises/0050-Loops/grid.png?raw=true)

  The size of the canvas is defined by the constant _SIZE_. The distance between the grid lines is defined by the constant _GRID_. It must be possible to change these values to draw different sizes of grids.

  The starter code already contains the canvas setup and the vertical lines. Your job is to add the horizontal lines.
  Use the vertical line code as a template for your _while_ loop.

      function setup() {
          // We have a square canvas. The side length is defined by the constant SIZE.
          const SIZE = 400;
          // Your job is to draw a grid on the canvas. The distance between the grid lines is defined by the constant GRID.
          const GRID = 25;

          createCanvas(SIZE, SIZE);
          background("black");

          strokeWeight(0.25);
          stroke("lightgray");

          // Draw a grid by using a while loop.
          
          // Part 1: Draw vertical lines
          // Here you see how to use a while loop.
          let i = GRID;            // STEP 1: Initialize the loop variable
          while (i < SIZE) {       // STEP 2: Check the loop condition
              line(i, 0, i, SIZE); // STEP 3: Do whatever you want to do repeatedly
              i += GRID;           // STEP 4: Update the loop variable
          }

          // Part 2: Draw horizontal lines
          // <<< Write your code here
      }
