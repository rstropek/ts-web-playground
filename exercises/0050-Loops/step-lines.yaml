  # Step Lines

  This exercise is an extension of the previous _Grid_ exercise. You have to add colored lines as shown in the image below:

  ![Step Lines](https://github.com/rstropek/ts-web-playground/blob/main/exercises/0050-Loops/step-lines.png?raw=true)

  The size of the canvas is defined by the constant _SIZE_. The distance between the grid lines is defined by the constant _GRID_. It must be possible to change these values to draw different sizes of grids.

  **Tip:** Finish drawing the left part of the lines using a _while_ loop. Only if that works, try to add the right part of the lines.
