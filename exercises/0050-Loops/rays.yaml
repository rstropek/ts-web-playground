  # Rays

  In this exercise, you have to draw "rays" from the edges of the canvas to the mouse position.

  ![Rays](https://github.com/rstropek/ts-web-playground/blob/main/exercises/0050-Loops/rays.gif?raw=true)

  The size of the canvas is defined by the constant _SIZE_. The distance between the grid lines is defined by the constant _MARGIN_. It must be possible to change these values to draw different sizes of grids.

      const SIZE = 400;  // Canvas size (square)
      const MARGIN = 25; // Margin between the edges and the rays.
                         // This is also the distance between the rays.

      function setup() {
        createCanvas(SIZE, SIZE);
        background("black");
      }

      function mouseMoved() {
        background("black");
        strokeWeight(2);

        // <<< Add your code here
      }
