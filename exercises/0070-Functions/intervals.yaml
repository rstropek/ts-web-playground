  # Intervals

  Function are useful in many situations, for instance:

  * Split large problems into smaller, more manageable parts
  * Reuse code
  * Make code more readable

  In this exercise, you will learn another application of function in TypeScript. You will create a simple function that draws a random circle. This function will be called every second. We say that the function is called at regular _intervals_.

  Note that a function that is called by someone else (in this case the interval timer) is called a _callback function_. Callback functions are a common concept in programming.

  Here is the code that you have to type. **Take the time to really understand what is happening in the code.**
