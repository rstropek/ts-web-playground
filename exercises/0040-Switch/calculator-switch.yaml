  # Calculator (with _if_)

  Let's write a program that could act as a basic UI for a simple calculator. It is not necessary to implement the full functionality of a calculator. Users should just be able to enter numbers by clicking on digits. Additionally, a _C_ (clear) button should be provided to reset the current number. Here is how the UI should look like:

  Note that your UI implementation must be responsive. If you change the size of the canvas (_createCanvas()_), the UI components should be scaled accordingly. Here are three different variants of the UI with different canvas sizes:

  As a first step, use _if_ statements to implement the code for this exercise. In the next exercise, you will refactor the code to use _switch_ statements instead.

      let cellWidth: number = 0;    // Width of a cell of the responsive layout

      function setup() {
          createCanvas(300, 600);
          lineHeight = height / 5;
          cellWidth = width / 3;
      }

          background("lightgray");

          // <<< Add code here
