  # Random Cards

  Write a program that displays a random card from a deck of cards:

  ![Random Card](https://github.com/rstropek/ts-web-playground/blob/main/exercises/0040-Switch/random-card.png?raw=true)
  
  The deck consists of four colors (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades) and thirteen ranks (Ace, 2, 3, ..., 10, Jack, Queen, King). The card images can be found at _https://cddataexchange.blob.core.windows.net/images/cards/<color>/<card>.png_.

  Here is a table for all the colors and their corresponding file names:

  | Color    | URL part |
  |----------|----------|
  | Clubs    | clubs    |
  | Diamonds | diamonds |
  | Hearts   | hearts   |
  | Spades   | spades   |

  Here is a table for all the ranks and their corresponding file names:

  | Rank | URL part |
  |------|----------|
  | Ace  | A        |
  | 2    | 2        |
  | 3    | 3        |
  | ...  | ...      |
  | 10   | 10       |
  | Jack | J        |
  | Queen| Q        |
  | King | K        |

  For example, the URL for the Queen of Spades is _https://cddataexchange.blob.core.windows.net/images/cards/spades/Q.png_. The one for the Ace of Clubs is _https://cddataexchange.blob.core.windows.net/images/cards/clubs/A.png_.

  Complete the starter code. **Use _switch_ statements, not _if_ statements.**
