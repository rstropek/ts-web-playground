  # Soccer Field

  You were hired by a local TV station. They want to show the starting lineup of a soccer team in a graphical way. You decide to create a simple visualization of a soccer field with the players' numbers and names:

  ![Soccer Field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstropek/ts-web-playground/refs/heads/main/exercises/0060-Arrays/soccer-field.png)

  ## Task: Draw the Soccer Field

  The soccer field must be a scaled-down version of a real soccer field. You can find the dimensions of a real soccer field [at https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafraum#/media/Datei:Fu%C3%9Fballfeld_mit_Ma%C3%9Fen_und_Beschreibung.svg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafraum#/media/Datei:Fu%C3%9Fballfeld_mit_Ma%C3%9Fen_und_Beschreibung.svg). Your field must be as close as possible to the real field. The field must be scaled by a constant _SCALE_. The field must have a margin of _MARGIN_ pixels around it.

  ## Task: Draw the Players

  You have a list of player numbers and a list of first names and last names. You must draw the player numbers and names on the field **exactly as shown in the screenshot above**:

  * The player number needs to be in orange and right-aligned.
  * The player name needs to be in yellow and left-aligned.

  BTW - of course you can replace the player numbers and names with your own favorite players ðŸ˜‰.

      // It must be possible to scale the entire field by changing the value of the constant SCALE.
      // E.g. a SCALE value of 2 will create a small image, while a SCALE value of 10 will create a large image.
      const SCALE = 5;

      // Margin around the field (i.e. distance from edge to the field)
      const MARGIN = 4;

          // Draw a semi-transparent rectangle as a background for the player names and numbers
          // NEW: Note that the color value has EIGHT hex digits, not six.
          // The last two digits represent the alpha value (transparency).
          // The hex value d0 (208 in decimal) is 80% opaque.
          fill("#008000d0");
