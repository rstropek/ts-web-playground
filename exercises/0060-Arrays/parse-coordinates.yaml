  # Parse Coordinates

  In this exercise, you have to _parse_ a string. _Parsing_ is the process of analyzing a string and extracting information from it. In this case, you have to extract the coordinates of circles from a string.

  The starter code contains a string that represents the coordinates of circles. Each circle is defined by a pair of numbers separated by a comma. The first number is the x-coordinate, the second number is the y-coordinate. The coordinates of the circles are separated by a space. For example, the string _"50,50 50,100 100,50 100,100"_ defines four circles. The first circle is at position (50,50), the second circle is at position (50,100), and so on.

  The output of this exercise must be:

  Your task is to write code that parses the string and draws the circles. Each circle must have a radius of 40. You **must not** extract the coordinates manually. You have to write code that **extracts the coordinates from the string**. In this exercise, you **must not use the _split_ function**.

  To solve this exercise, follow these steps:

  1. Start by extracting the first pair of coordinates from the string and draw a single circle. Remember: You can access a character in a string by using the square brackets notation. For example, _circles[1]_ returns the second character of the string (in the starter code, this would be _0_).
  2. Find a solution that extracts pairs of coordinates in a loop and draws all the circles.

  **Tip:** If you have a string containing the digits of a number (e.g. _"42"_), you can convert it to a number using the _parseInt_ function. For example, _parseInt("42")_ returns the number 42.
