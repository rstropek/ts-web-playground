  # Bouncing Ball (Advanced)

  This is a more advanced version of the previous _bouncing ball_ exercise. In the previous version, the balls only flew from left to right or from top to bottom. Now, we focus on a single ball but it should move diagonally. The ball should bounce back when it reaches the left, right, top, or bottom border of the canvas.

  **Tip:** Use the previous exercise (the one with a single ball) as a starting point. Modify the code to make the ball move diagonally.
