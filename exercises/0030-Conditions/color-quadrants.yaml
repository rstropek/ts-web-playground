  # Color Quadrants

  ## Introduction

  This exercise is similar to the previous one. However, this time the canvas is split up into four quadrants. Each quadrant has a different color.

  This time, you have to implement the logic yourself. Revisit the previous exercise if you need a refresher on how to use the _if_ statement. When you finish, the interaction should work like this (note that the circle around the mouse cursor is just to help you visualize the click area, you do _not_ need to add it):
