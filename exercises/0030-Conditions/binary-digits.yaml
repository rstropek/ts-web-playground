  # BinaryDigits

  This exercise builds on the previous one. This time, you do not have to split the number into decimal digits, but into binary digits. The output must look like this:

  ## Tip

  In the last exercise, you already learned how to extract the digits of a number. You used _% 10_ and _Math.floor(num / 10)_. This time, you need to extract the binary digits of a number. What do you have to change to switch from base-10 (decimal) to base-2 (binary)?
