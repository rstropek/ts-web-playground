  # Rock-Paper-Scissors Part 1

  In this exercise, we build a simple _Rock-Paper-Scissors_ game.

  ![Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://github.com/rstropek/ts-web-playground/blob/main/exercises/0030-Conditions/rps-animation.gif?raw=true)

  In the first part, you have to draw the three options from which the user can choose. Additionally, you have to implement the _hover_ effect for the options. For now, ignore the random computer choice and the result of the game. We will add these features in the next part of this exercise.

  Here is a detailed UI design that you have to follow as closely as possible:

  Note: The second part of this exercise contains a sample solution for this part. **Do not look at it until you have completed this part yourself!** Once you have completed this part, continue with the second part and compare your solution with the sample solution. What did you do differently?

  ## Step 1: Draw the options

  As a first step, you have to draw the three options from which the user can choose. Use the emojis ü™®üìÉ‚úÇÔ∏è to represent _Rock_, _Paper_, and _Scissors_.

  ## Step 2: Implement the hover effect
  
  Whenever the mouse moves over an option, draw a yellow border around it. If the mouse is no longer over the option, draw a black border to remove the highlight. Use _if_ statements in combination with _mouseX_ and _mouseY_ to check whether the mouse is over an option.
